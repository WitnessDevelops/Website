# Ideas for Website

- Allowing the Discord Bot to connect to the website to add Premium users
- Adding a list of commands.
- Naming "Commands" to Documentation (image of something in dms soon
- Part of website where we can login as Developers and control anything the bot does on the websie (control panel for devs)

About all for now.
